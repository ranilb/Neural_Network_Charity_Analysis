# Neural Network Charity Analysis

In this work, we will implement neural networks algorithms to determine where to support with funding using the TensorFlow platform in Python. This is due to the misuse of fundings from some organizations over the past years.

### Data 
For the analysis, [data](https://github.com/ranilb/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/charity_data.csv) that ontains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from a funding agency over the years.
